You have some coins.  The i-th coin has a probability prob[i] of facing heads when tossed.

Return the probability that the number of coins facing heads equals target if you toss every coin exactly once.

 

Example 1:

Input: prob = [0.4], target = 1
Output: 0.40000
Example 2:

Input: prob = [0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5], target = 0
Output: 0.03125
 

Constraints:

1 <= prob.length <= 1000
0 <= prob[i] <= 1
0 <= target <= prob.length
Answers will be accepted as correct if they are within 10^-5 of the correct answer.
