A subsequence of a string s is considered a good palindromic subsequence if:
    It is a subsequence of s.
    It is a palindrome (has the same value if reversed).
    It has an even length.
    No two consecutive characters are equal, except the two middle ones.
For example, if s = "abcabcabb", then "abba" is considered a good palindromic subsequence, while "bcb" (not even length) and "bbbb" (has equal consecutive characters) are not.

Given a string s, return the length of the longest good palindromic subsequence in s.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "bbabab"
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest good palindromic subsequence of s is "baab".
Example 2:

Input: s = "dcbccacdb"
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest good palindromic subsequence of s is "dccd".
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 250
s consists of lowercase English letters.
