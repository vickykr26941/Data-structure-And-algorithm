In combinatorial mathematics, a derangement is a permutation of the elements of a set, such that no element appears in its original position.

You are given an integer n. There is originally an array consisting of n integers from 1 to n in ascending order, return the number of derangements it can generate.
Since the answer may be huge, return it modulo 109 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: The original array is [1,2,3]. The two derangements are [2,3,1] and [3,1,2].
Example 2:

Input: n = 2
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 106
