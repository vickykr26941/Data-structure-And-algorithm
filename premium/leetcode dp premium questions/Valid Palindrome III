Given a string s and an integer k, return true if s is a k-palindrome.

A string is k-palindrome if it can be transformed into a palindrome by removing at most k characters from it.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcdeca", k = 2
Output: true
Explanation: Remove 'b' and 'e' characters.
Example 2:

Input: s = "abbababa", k = 1
Output: true
 

Constraints:

  1 <= s.length <= 1000
  s consists of only lowercase English letters.
  1 <= k <= s.length
