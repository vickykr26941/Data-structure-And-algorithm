Given an array of n integers nums and an integer target, 
find the number of index triplets i, j, k with 0 <= i < j < k < n that satisfy the condition nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < target.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-2,0,1,3], target = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Because there are two triplets which sums are less than 2:
[-2,0,1]
[-2,0,3]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [], target = 0
Output: 0
Example 3:

Input: nums = [0], target = 0
Output: 0
 

Constraints:
    n == nums.length
    0 <= n <= 3500
    -100 <= nums[i] <= 100
    -100 <= target <= 100
