Given a string s, find out the length of the longest repeating substring(s). Return 0 if no repeating substring exists.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcd"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no repeating substring.
Example 2:

Input: s = "abbaba"
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest repeating substrings are "ab" and "ba", each of which occurs twice.
Example 3:

Input: s = "aabcaabdaab"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest repeating substring is "aab", which occurs 3 times.
Example 4:

Input: s = "aaaaa"
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest repeating substring is "aaaa", which occurs twice.
 

Constraints:

      The string s consists of only lowercase English letters from 'a' - 'z'.
      1 <= s.length <= 1500
