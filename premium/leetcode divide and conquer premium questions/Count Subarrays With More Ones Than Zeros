You are given a binary array nums containing only the integers 0 and 1. Return the number of subarrays in nums that have more 1's than 0's.
Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

A subarray is a contiguous sequence of elements within an array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 9
Explanation:
      The subarrays of size 1 that have more ones than zeros are: [1], [1], [1]
      The subarrays of size 2 that have more ones than zeros are: [1,1]
      The subarrays of size 3 that have more ones than zeros are: [0,1,1], [1,1,0], [1,0,1]
      The subarrays of size 4 that have more ones than zeros are: [1,1,0,1]
      The subarrays of size 5 that have more ones than zeros are: [0,1,1,0,1]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: 0
Explanation:
No subarrays have more ones than zeros.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The subarrays of size 1 that have more ones than zeros are: [1]
 

Constraints:

      1 <= nums.length <= 105
      0 <= nums[i] <= 1
